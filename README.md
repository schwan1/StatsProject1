# StatsProject1
# Applied Statistics Project 1
There are two main objectives for Project 1.  Since each group will be using their own data set, there will be a little flexibility in what needs to be delivered.  Below is a summary of what is absolutely necessary as part of your report.
Objective 1: Display the ability to build regression models using the skills and discussions from Unit 1 and 2.   

Objective 1: Display the ability to build regression models using the skills and discussions from Unit 1 and 2.   
•	Perform your regression analysis and report the predictive ability of your model using a test set or some other means through CV.  Be sure to provide metrics if you compare multiple models.
•	Provide interpretation of the regression model including hypothesis testing, interpretation of regression coefficients, and confidence intervals.  Practical vs Statistical significance.

Objective 2:  Perform a secondary analysis using the tools from Unit 3, Unit 4, or Unit 5.  You only need to do one, pick the one that makes the most sense.  This can be an entirely different data set or a repurpose of your data set in Objective 1.  The goal for this objective is to demonstrate your basic understanding of the analysis workflow and writing conclusions.
•	Two Way ANOVA -  I required you guys to make sure there are at least 2 categorical variables and this is that reason.  Using the two categorical predictors in your data set, pretend that these are the only variables available to you and perform a Two Way ANOVA analysis.  (Of course this would not be the correct thing to do given we have access to other variables, but illustrate your ability to perform the analysis in this exercise).
•	
•	Time Series - Many times in regression analysis the observational rows in the data set are collected over time and not really mentioned or recorded.  Create an additional variable in your data set denoted “time” and code it from 1 to the total sample size (It can be the entire data set, or the training or the test set).  Use your knowledge and understanding of time series to assess if the assumption of independent errors of your final regression model is actually a valid assumption.  
•	Repeated measures – This is my area of expertise.  I have a few data sets if you want just something completely different to play with.  Some classic regression data sets may have some reasons to apply a repeated measures analysis.  If your data set fits this situation it would be cool to compare the regular regression model to a repeated measures version to see how much the results change or if conclusions are different.
